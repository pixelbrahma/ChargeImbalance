# ChargeImbalance
A 2d sideways shooter game using c++ and allegro


The aim of the game is to not let any enemy ships past the line barrier upon which the player slides up and down.
player can either shoot down the enemy ship or can absorb them with their own ship
absorbing gains more points than shooting
absorbing higher amounts also makes the game harder by faster and more enemy spawn(speed and number both multiplied by a multiplier)
the faster enemies offer much higher points than the slower ones.(shooting or absorbing is multiplied by a multiplier)
game ends after the player loses all his lives
starts with 3 lives but gains a life every time the game gets harder(when the multiplier comes inot play)
animation effects for number of lives included too.
